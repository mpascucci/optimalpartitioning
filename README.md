# Optimal Partitioning
Implementation of the OP algorithm for C++ and Python.

## functions:

op1D : OP for piece-wise constant signal

op2D : OP for piece-wise linear signals

op2D : OP for piece-wise continuous linear signals with continuity constraint. Thi function does not find the optimal solution (in term of square error) but has the same complecity as OP and is optimized with the same pruning.
